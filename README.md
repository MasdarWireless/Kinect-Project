Kinect-Project
==============

Kinect project for use in Masdar Institute. As my first research task.


## Introduction  ##
ACM e-Energy conference. Submission deadline. Jan. 15th.

* Build a model for the building. And do some simulation with it.

* There is a complex model, but that's for the whole building.

* The ventilation is **exactly** controlled by the # of people.

    * Find out how you set ventilation rate.
    * Change the set point. Or increase the set point. Choose ONE.
    * Reclaim some stuff based on **real data** collected from
      balabala.
    * You cannot change your set point here? *Well, that's a good
      point.*
    * In the discussion part, we have to do some **real stuff**.

* Use a metric called **PMV** to justify.

* **We need an algorithm here!!!**

* **Create a VALID algorithm that can be used in the dynamic control
  field.** Using the transition matrix.
        





## Implementation  ##
* Software
    * E-Quest
    * Energy Plus (download and play with them. That's for some basic
      simulation. )

* Better to divide one floor for 3 zones.

* I want to see **Dynamic Control** here.

* [The open source implementation in buildings.][BACnet]
  [BACnet]: http://bacnet.sourceforge.net/







## Some Problems  ##
* The zone is still open.



## Notes ##
1. Have some Skype meetings with Dr. Sid.

2. Do as yo have planned in your org.


    
## TODO ##
1. Check the MATLAB codes and modify it, to make it properly train the
   Markov model, **or any other** model that can take input like this
   and produce **meaningful** result!

2. Read relevant papers, and better your writing skills. Or you would
   be kicked AWAY from **Masdar Institute of Science and Technology**.

    * Check the data format.
    * See if any up-to-date model that is working fine with it.
    * if not, see if any practical model and/or algorithm can be built
      out of it. (**Dude, that's the REAL stuff.**)
    * Work hard. Do not cry.
