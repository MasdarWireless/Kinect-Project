# Auto Screenshot  #
Just another tiny shell script or (maybe) python program. Auto refresh
web page and take a screenshot of the whole screen (I suppose this
could be updated). Then save the screenshot to a specific folder.

## Implementation  ##
* Keyboard "F5" simulation (finished with a Chrome plug-in)
* System screenshot program, calling. (xwd in fine. Now try to make it
  automatic.)
* Save the screenshot to a specific folder. (partially finished. But I
  have problems with the naming.)


`sleep 5; xwd | convert -
/home/abrahamx91/Professional/Git/Kinect-Project/capture.png` A line
of this code will capture the whole screen. But the naming is
something that I do not know and (more importantly, do not have the
time to solve......I have the book. Practice will be done in the
vacation.)
