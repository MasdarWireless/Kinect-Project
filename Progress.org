* Comments:
  - The MATLAB code is well-written by, well, someone. But I also have
    trouble debugging it.
  - Judging from this file [[https://github.com/ProfessorX/Kinect-Project/blob/master/Archive/Kinect%2520based%2520Building%2520Energy%2520Managment/MarkovChain/data/tempOccMat.txt][A sample of some days' occupancy data]], if
    we assume the People Counting software works fine, then there is
    something wrong with the "calculation algorithm".
  - I doubt yet another time the equations used below. But right now I
    can do nothing more about it...
  - Where the heck is your Jie Cao? I have lost it.

* Future work

** Finish the two MATLAB codes as required.

** Try to modify her paper, if that's necessary enough.

** Be a good student. Make money by creating value.

** Finish the MATLAB part. But I am not 100% clear whether I am capable to make the Markov chain lively again.


* Something more about the Markov Chain

** Modify the code so that it applies to (or make it runs) 4 zone case
   - [ ] Make sure what kind of algorithm to take, so that we can have
     a Markov model for 4 zones...
   - [ ] In this case, I hope that indeed we can work something
     out. Instead of following what others are sucking and fucking.
   - 

* Something more about the paper

 

* Footnotes

[fn:1] This is done in some other papers.[[file:Archive/Kinect%20based%20Building%20Energy%20Managment/Litreture%20Papers/Erickson10a.pdf][Markov Chain model reference paper.]]
