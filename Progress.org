* Comments:
  - The MATLAB code is well-written by, well, someone. But I also have
    trouble debugging it.
  - Judging from this file [[https://github.com/ProfessorX/Kinect-Project/blob/master/Archive/Kinect%2520based%2520Building%2520Energy%2520Managment/MarkovChain/data/tempOccMat.txt][A sample of some days' occupancy data]], if
    we assume the People Counting software works fine, then there is
    something wrong with the "calculation algorithm".
  - I doubt yet another time the equations used below. But right now I
    can do nothing more about it...
  - Where the heck is your Jie Cao? I have lost it.
